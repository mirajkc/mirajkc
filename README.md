### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>


I’m **Miraj**, an full-stack web developer from Nepal.

I love building web applications. If I get an idea, I usually try to bring it to life.

My main tech stack includes **React, Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Tailwind and Mongoose**. I enjoy designing and building both the front-end and back-end of apps.

One project I’m really proud of is [Sensei](https://github.com/mirajkc/Sensei) — it’s a project that showcases my skills and passion for full-stack development.

I’ve created **many projects** and I love learning new tools and technologies along the way.

**Hobbies:** coding, anime, gaming, and exploring new techs
